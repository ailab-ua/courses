</ul><h3><a name="objectives" id="objectives"></a>COURSE OBJECTIVES</h3>
<p>Business intelligence and analytics and the related field of big data analytics have become increasingly important in both the academic and the business communities over the past two decades. The IBM Tech Trends Report identified business analytics as one of the four major technology trends in the 2010s and beyond. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute predicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep data analytical skills, as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions. Big data and data science have begun to transform different facets of the society, from e-commerce and global logistics, to smart health and cyber security.</p>
<p>This undergraduate senior level course (elective) will cover the important concepts and techniques related to data analytics, including: statistical foundation, data mining methods, data visualization, AI, deep learning, and web mining techniques that are applicable to emerging e-commerce, government, and health and security applications.</p>
<p><strong>The course will be conducted in a graduate-level format, containing lectures, discussions, readings, lab sessions, and hands-on research projects. The course will support several diverse human and AI learning strategies: rote learning, learning by rules, learning from examples, learning by analogy, and learning by exploration.</strong></p>
<p>Most business school seniors with proper background and interest are welcome. The course will require some basic computing (Python, Java) and database (SQL) background. The course will prepare students to become a data scientist or a data-savvy manager for different businesses. The Course Objectives include the following:</p>

<h3><a name="prerequisite" id="prerequisite"></a>PREREQUISITE FOR THE COURSE</h3>
<p>Programming experience in selected modern computing languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++) and DBMS (SQL). This course is hands-on (but not heavy hand-holding), with support from a knowledgeable TA. The workload will be somewhat heavy (10-15 hours per week on average); so only students who are interested in pursuing a career in data analytics should register for this course. The instructor will allow for sit-in or audit for selected students based on their background and interest.</p>

</ul>
</ul><h3><a name="coursework" id="coursework"></a>COURSEWORK, EXAMS, AND ASSIGNMENTS</h3>
<p><strong>TEAM PROJECT PROPOSAL (5%)</strong></p>
<p>Each student will be required to form a two-person team with complementary skills (e.g., application knowledge, Python, SQL, analytics, presentation). A team proposal (3 pages, Word document) including plan for both review paper (see below) and research project (see below) will be submitted by each team in the third week of the semester. The proposal needs to justify the selection of application area and includes preliminary ideas or plan for execution.</p>
<p><h3>TEAM LAB ASSIGNMENTS (20%)</h3></p>
<p>In order to improve students’ hands-on data analytics knowledge and to facilitate final project execution, there will be two Team Lab Assignments: Tableau (visualization) and Weka (analytics), both are popular data analytics/visualization tools used by data analysts/scientists. Each team is required to identify 1-2 public or open data sources (e.g., data.gov, Kaggle; will be introduced in class) in the application area of their final Research Project (e.g., security, health, finance, e-commerce) and execute selected meaningful data exploration/visualization or analytics functions. Each assignment is worth 10% of final grade. A team report summarizing results with meaningful screen shots (5 pages, IEEE format; will be explained in class) needs to be submitted in two weeks for each assignment. Students are expected to become familiar with selected data extraction, analytics and visualization tools and software.</p>
<p><h3>MIDTERM EXAM (30%)</h3></p>
<p>The midterm exam will be closed book, closed notes and in the short-essay format. The questions will be based mostly on classroom lectures. There will be NO Final Exam for this class. Academic integrity will be strictly enforced. Consequences for cheating will be severe.</p>
<p><h3>REVIEW PAPER AND PRESENTATION (15%)</h3></p>
<p>Each team will select an emerging, specific data analytics application area of interest (e.g., health, finance, e-commerce, security) and develop a comprehensive review paper (5 pages, IEEE format) for the topic. Secondary literature review (10-20 references) will be needed based on recent papers published in major news media, magazines, conferences, and journals. Each team (both students) will be required to present their review in the second half of the semester (10 minutes with 8 slides). The instructor will suggest selected emerging application areas for consideration.&nbsp;</p>
<p><h3>TEAM RESEARCH PROJECT PRESENTATION/PAPER (30%)</h3></p>
<p>Each team will be required to propose and execute an interesting and meaningful data analytics research project for applications of interest to the students. The instructor will suggest suitable data and algorithms for consideration. The class TA will also provide assistance in data preparation and analytics using selected open source tools. Each team (both students) will present at the end of the semester (15 minutes with 12 slides) and a final research paper (8 pages, IEEE format) will be submitted after all presentation sessions. The instructor will provide details about the final paper format and structure. Students are expected to gain significant hands-on data analytics skills and knowledge and professional project communication and presentation experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p><h3>ATTENDANCE, PARTICIPATION AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY (10%)</h3></p>
<p>Students are required to attend all lectures on time and honor academic integrity. Missing classes will result in loss of points or administrative drop by the instructor. Students are required to send excuse notes (via email) to the instructor before missing classes. Students are permitted to bring laptop to classroom for note taking purposes, but not for checking email or web surfing. Professional attitude and strong work ethics are needed for this class. Students are encouraged to consult the instructor for advice and help.</p>
<p><h3>LAB SESSIONS and GUEST SPEAKERS</h3></p>
<p>Selected lab sessions will be provided by the class TA during the semester on the following topics: Python, Tableau, Weka, etc. Selected guest speakers may be invited to present in the class.</p>
<p><h3>D2L CLASS SUPPORT</h3></p>
<p>The class will be supported by D2L (by class TA) in the following areas: (1) class announcements, assignments, and email to the entire class, (2) students submitting assignments, papers, and presentation slides online, (3) grade postings and notifications for all students, (4) optional periodic quizzes to gauge students’ progress and understanding.</p>
